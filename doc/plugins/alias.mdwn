[[!template id=plugin name=alias author="[[Jon]]"]]
[[!tag type/link]]

This plugin implements [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] aliases. You may define aliases in
your setup file and reference the aliases in PageSpecs within your wiki.

## Example

With the following configuration:

    pagespec_aliases:
      blogposts: "blog/* and !blog/all and !tagged(ignore) and !image()"
      draft: "blogposts() and tagged(draft)"

The PageSpecs `blogpost()` and `draft()` have been defined. Notice that `draft()`
is defined in terms of `blogpost()`. Further examples of how these could be used
in wiki pages:

    \[[!inline pages="blogposts()"]]
    \[[!map pages="draft()"]]

## Caveats

IkiWiki currently does not track what pages use which PageSpecs, so you must
make sure to refresh the necessary pages (or rebuild the whole wiki) when you
make changes to their definitions.

It's currently not possible to configure PageSpec aliases via [[websetup]].
