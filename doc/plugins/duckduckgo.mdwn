This plugin adds a search form to the wiki, using DuckDuckGo's site search.

DuckDuckGo is asked to search for pages in the domain specified in the wiki's
`url` configuration parameter. Results will depend on whether DuckDuckGo has
indexed the site, and how recently.

The search form requires JavaScript to be enabled in the client's browser to
function correctly.

By comparison the [[search]] plugin offers full text search of only the wiki,
but requires that a search engine be installed on your site.
