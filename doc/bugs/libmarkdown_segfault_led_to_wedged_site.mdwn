So, apparently an img directive led to libmarkdown segfaulting, crashing
ikiwiki after it had rendered a html file but before it made note that it
had done so. 

The user saw an "Internal server error" and hit reload, which
failed due to the "independently created, not overwriting" check. The site
was then wedged not accepting edits until manually fixed.

After deleting the html file, `ikiwiki --refresh` successfully built
things, without libmarkdown segfaulting this time. I don't know if this was
a transient libmarkdown bug or a memory glitch. 

Either way, seems that ikiwiki could better handle recovery from this kind
of scenario. The "independently created" check has a security benefit...
Perhaps ikiwiki could keep a log file of destdir files it's recently
created but has yet to record in the index, and then the check can be
skipped for those files.
