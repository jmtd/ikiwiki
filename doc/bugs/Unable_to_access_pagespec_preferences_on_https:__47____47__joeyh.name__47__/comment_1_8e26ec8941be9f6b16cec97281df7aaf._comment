Sending an auth token with every notification email would
not be good from a security POV.

But, the ikiwiki username that has subscribed could be included in the
emails; the url to the prefs could possibly even have it prefilled
(unless CSRF protection or something prevents that).

No, ikiwiki accounts are not connected like this. If you log in with the
old account it will have separate subscription prefs than the new account.
