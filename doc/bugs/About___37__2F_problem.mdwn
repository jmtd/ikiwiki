I use inline to create a blog like the below:

    \[[!inline pages="./bugs/* and !./bugs/done and !./bugs/discussion and 
    !link(patch) and !link(./bugs/done) and !./bugs/*/*"
    actions=yes rootpage="./bugs" postform="yes" postformtext="请用一句话简述问题，然后点击 Edit 按钮添加具体细节" show=0]]


When I use posform to add a new page, it show:

> Error: bad page name 

Its url include a %2F, like below:

> http://172.16.0.109/ikiwiki.cgi?do=blog&from=.%2Fbugs&subpage=1&title=aaa

I use ikiwiki 3.20180311

----

I have found that it is not "%2F"'s problem, it just that inline directive can
not deal with Chinese char, the below link can work

    http://172.16.0.109/ikiwiki.cgi?do=blog&from=aaa%2Fbugs&subpage=1&title=aaa
