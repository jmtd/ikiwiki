[[!template  id=gitbranch branch=feature/15355-po-plugin-disable-languages author="[[hefee]]"]]

`po_disabled_languages` is used to disable languages on the website. It
can be used to prepare new translations, while it will hide those from
the end-user. More precisely, PO files for these languages are updated
normally, however, HTML creation will be disabled and no reference to
these translations will be visible on the website.

> As with everything else in the `po` plugin: I would really want to see
> some regression test coverage before merging this, because as far as I'm
> aware none of the ikiwiki maintainers use the `po` plugin, so we are
> not able to detect regressions other than via the automated tests. That
> isn't a good situation to be in for a plugin that uses `IkiWiki::inject`
> to monkey-patch ikiwiki internals. If this plugin is important to you,
> more test coverage would be very much appreciated.
