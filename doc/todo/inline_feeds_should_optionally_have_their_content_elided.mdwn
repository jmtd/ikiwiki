[[!tag wishlist]]
[[plugins/inline]] has a parameter `archive` which enables displaying
metadata about matching pages (title, date) rather than their full
contents. This does not influence the content of any generated feeds:
they always include the full content.

There should be a way to elide the content of inlined pages in generated
feeds, either by doing so when `archive=yes` is set (potentially changing
the behaviour of existing deployments, but less configuration cruft) or
adding yet further configuration options to `inline`.

use-case: I want to generate a (semi-private) feed of every blog post I
have ever written, both on my live site and on my test one, so I can
compare the publication dates. (some blog posts have dates fixed by
meta directives; other rely on the file ctime, which is not preserved
in the parent git repositories.) *â€” [[Jon]], 2020-04-27*
