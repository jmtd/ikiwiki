It would be nice for some plugins to use hashes as setup data structures
(which ones? pagespec aliases for one.  Any others?), but these cannot
currently be adequately described in `getsetup()`, nor represented in
`websetup()`.  It would be nice to extend ikiwiki to support this.

I've had an initial go at how to represent this in a nice way within a HTML
page.  An initial mock up is available at
<https://github.com/jmtd/ikiwiki/blob/websetup_hashes/hash.html>.  The
approach taken is to use a javascript hash/dictionary as the canonical copy of
the data; to express that in the form elements, and to capture all relevant
events to update the main data structure (and the HTML representations
thereof).

I imagine packing the js structure into a form element which is posted, and
ignoring the other form element data.

This would mean mandating javascript support for editing such hashes.
