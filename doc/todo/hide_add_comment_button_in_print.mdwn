Print versions are often a neglected part of a style sheet, but it's
great when people can actually print your webpage and get a satisfying
result.

This often means removing a bunch of stuff that are irrelevant for
print. Ikiwiki already does a bunch of those things in the
base stylesheet:

    /* things to hide in printouts */
    @media print {
    	.actions { display: none; }
    	.tags { display: none; }
    	.trails { display: none; }
    	.feedbutton { display: none; }
    	#searchform { display: none; }
    	.blogform, #blogform { display: none; }
    	#backlinks { display: none; }
    }

But I think we should remove more. In particular, the `addcomment`
button is not relevant at all for print versions. There might be more:
in my [bootstrap theme][], I also had to [remove][] the whole footer,
because it was overlapping with the page content. It's unfortunate
because it removes the copyright notice, but I don't know how else to
fix this.

Anyways, how about [this patch][]?
