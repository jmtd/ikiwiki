I think the following would be useful.  Have a plugin (pagecopyright? dunno about the name), configured
by an "association-list"
<pre>
copyright_alist=>[ "*/Discussion" => "Comments copyright individual authors",
                   "*"=> "Copyright 2008 Widget Co" ]
</pre>

And yes, I know about [[plugins/contrib/default_content_for___42__copyright__42___and___42__license__42__]]
