[[!tag patch]]

> It looks as though this patch would break linkification in any syntactic construct that
> uses indentation but isn't a code block, for instance a list:
>
>     * This is a list
>         * So is this
>             * And \[[this is a link|http://example.com]]
>
> rendered as:
>
> * This is a list
>     * So is this
>         * And [[this is a link|http://example.com]]
>
> It's also assuming that Markdown is the only language available (trying to use Markdown
> rules), and even in Markdown it doesn't support Github-style fenced code blocks if enabled.
>
> This is not something that can be done correctly by just patching the link plugin.
> I'm not sure whether it's something that can be done correctly at all, unfortunately.
